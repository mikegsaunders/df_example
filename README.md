# National Library of Scotland catalogue of published material (sample)
[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/888907022.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14168884)


This dataset contains the bibliographic records from the Libraryâ€™s catalogue of published material: books, maps, music, journals, newspapers, pamphlets, flyers and more, and includes records for printed and digital publications. It excludes records from our catalogue where we believe the originator exerts rights over the re-use of the metadata. 

This is a subset of the full version to test DOI and push workflows.

The data is made available in DCMI Metadata Terms format.  The DC metadata terms are expressed in RDF vocabularies, which can be used in linked data applications, as well as in XML, JSON, and UML environments and relational databases.

We are considering additional formats for future releases and welcome feedback on this.
